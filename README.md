# MobileSales_PowerBI_Project

🚀 Just Created My First Interactive Power BI Dashboard! 📊

I’m excited to share a project I recently completed — a fully interactive Mobile Sales Dashboard built using Power BI!

This dashboard brings together key insights such as:
✔️ Total Sales & Quantity
✔️ Average Selling Price
✔️ Transactions by Payment Method
✔️ City-wise Sales Distribution
✔️ Year-over-Year Comparison
✔️ Mobile Model & Brand-wise Analysis
✔️ Ratings & Customer Feedback

Working on this helped me understand the power of data visualization, DAX functions, and the art of turning raw data into business insights.

🔹 Tools Used: Power BI, DAX, Data Modeling
🔹 Skills Gained: Dashboard Design, Interactive Filtering, Trend Analysis

Swipe through to see snapshots of the dashboard in action! 📷

Grateful for the learning journey — and looking forward to building more advanced dashboards soon. 💡
